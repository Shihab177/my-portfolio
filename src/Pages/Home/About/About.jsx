            I began my programming journey in 2023, learning HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript on my mobile due to the lack of a laptop. From 2024, I
            focused entirely on web development, learning the MERN stack through
            Programming Hero and building several full-stack projects. I am
            passionate about backend systems, frontend logic, and especially
            debugging and problem-solving. I focus on writing clean, structured,
            and well-commented code that is easy to read and maintain. Tackling
            challenging errors has strengthened my patience and resilience.
            Currently, I work independently, but I am eager to gain team
            collaboration experience to further enhance my skills and
            adaptability. Outside of coding, I enjoy photography, music, and
            cooking. I am naturally curious, a deep learner, and adaptable â€”
            able to handle pressure, adjust to new codebases, and quickly master
            new skills.
